    Tool info for SAF (Static Analyzer Factory), an analyzer for C programs.

    SAF is run through its "verify" subcommand, which is its SV-COMP entry
    point. That subcommand writes exactly one verdict line to stdout, always one
    of the BenchExec RESULT_* strings, and every diagnostic message to stderr.

    Properties that SAF has a strategy for, with the verdicts it reports for
    each of them in the current version:
      unreach-call     "false(unreach-call)"
      valid-memsafety  "false(valid-deref)", "false(valid-free)"
      no-overflow      "false(no-overflow)"
      termination      "true"
      no-data-race     "true", "false(no-data-race)"
    Every other property, valid-memcleanup and the coverage properties for
    example, yields "unknown", and so does every task that a strategy cannot
    decide. This module does not depend on the table above: it accepts any
    RESULT_* verdict that SAF prints, including subproperties not listed here.

    A property file is required. SAF reads the CHECK(... LTL ...) directive out
    of the given .prp file and never looks at the file name, so it cannot run
    without one, and this module rejects tasks that have no property file.

    This module adds two arguments of its own:
      --property <file>        the property file of the task
      --data-model ILP32|LP64  the data model, when the task defines one; SAF
                               assumes LP64 otherwise
    All further arguments are taken from the benchmark definition and passed on
    unchanged. The useful ones are "--witness <file>", the path that SAF writes
    the witness of a task to, and "--timeout <seconds>", a wall-clock budget
    after which SAF reports "unknown" by itself instead of waiting to be killed.
    Neither is required: SAF defaults to "witness.yml", the name that SV-COMP
    expects, and to a budget slightly below the SV-COMP time limit. Note that
    BenchExec does not expand ${witness} inside option values, so if a witness
    file name is given here at all it has to be spelled out literally.

    The tool archive has the executable in bin/saf and the data files that SAF
    needs, stub headers and function specifications, under share/saf/. SAF
    looks for the latter relative to its own executable, so those two
    directories have to stay siblings.
